# üì±Project: JavaScript Calculator - Factory Functions Edition

## üìÑ Description

### Em Portugu√™s:

Este √© o meu primeiro projeto JavaScript entre o intermedi√°rio ao avan√ßado, explorando o que chamamos de: 'Factory Functions'. A proposta foi criar uma calculadora funcional e interativa, utilizando o poder das fun√ß√µes de f√°brica para organizar e modularizar o c√≥digo. O objetivo principal foi praticar os conceitos de manipula√ß√£o do DOM, tratamento de eventos e, principalmente, a aplica√ß√£o de padr√µes de design JavaScript para construir uma aplica√ß√£o que testasse meus conhecimentos e fosse de f√°cil manuten√ß√£o.

### In English:

This is my first intermediate-to-advanced JavaScript project, exploring what we call 'Factory Functions.' The goal was to create a functional and interactive calculator, leveraging the power of factory functions to organize and modularize code. The main objective was to practice the concepts of DOM manipulation, event handling, and, most importantly, the application of JavaScript design patterns to build an application that tests my knowledge and is easy to maintain.
